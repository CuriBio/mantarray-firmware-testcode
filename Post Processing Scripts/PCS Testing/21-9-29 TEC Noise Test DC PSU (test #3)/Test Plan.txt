The tests that were performed were:

2021-9-29_15-35-54_data:
~2 mins of steady state, TEC and PSU off
~2 mins of TEC at 1 A with DC PSU
~2 mins of cooldown, TEC and PSU off

2021-9-29_15-44-3_data:
~2 mins of normal shop noise, some power tools were turning on and off in the neighboring room

2021-9-29_15-50-29_data:
~30 sec off, ~30 sec on intervals for each step
With DC PSU, stairstep TEC current 0 > .1 > 0 >.2 > 0 > .3 > … > 1 > 0
With DC PSU, stairstep TEC current 0 > .1 > .2 > .3 > … > 1 > .9 > .8 > … > 0
    i. In test 3c above, there was one blip where the current knob was briefly accidentally changed the wrong way. It was somewhere around the .6 A step on the way back down to 0. Will probably show up as some weird blips in the magnetometer data.

~1 min of TEC and stimulation off
~1 min of TEC at 1 A with DC PSU
~1 min of TEC and stimulation off
~1 min of stimulators on at default settings
~1 min of TEC and stimulation off
~1 min of TEC at 1 A and stimulators on at default settings
