v1.0.0
I guess this is a real tool now that we are sending to people.  That's neat I guess ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

v1.0.1
Fixed a bad bug where the tool would select the wrong COM port when connected
Made an incorrect assumption that computers wouldn't have more than 1 serial device connected, but apparently Bluetooth sometimes uses simulated COM ports?
As a fun discovery, I found out that making Linux support would be easy during the fix process, so we can add that as a potential option down the line

v1.0.2
Fixed the length of stimulator configuration packets by removing the stimulator period from the metadata

future devs:
v1.0.3 (ETA 8-5-21)
Different colors for toggle buttons
